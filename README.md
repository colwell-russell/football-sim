## Notes
- Load realm-export into keycloak  
-- You will have to create a new user  
-- Realm Frontend URL should be http://localhost:9000/auth/  for local host testing
- Other notes  
-- Currently not working if everything is ran under docker compose but will work if keycloak is runnigni n container and apps are running on local. Not sure why.
